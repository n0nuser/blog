This is a [now](https://nownownow.com/about) page. It serves as an update on what you’re currently focusing on, inspired by [Derek Sivers' /now](https://sive.rs/now) page concept.

***Updated on 22nd June, 2024***

I would love to think of it and have something *clear* to say, but there's nothing very important as of now going on.

## Work

I **finished Computer Engineering 2 years ago**, and have been **working at** Panelais and now at **uXcale**, a tech consulting firm. In this company I have been working **for Quant AI Lab** (AI company) **and** now for almost 8 months at **Santander Bank**.

**Got recently the Scrum Master certification** and so far I'm loving the scrum methodology, really helps set objectives and a healthy mindset around "work" being it professional or personal.

## Sport

As for my life... **quit gym** last summer (and therefore powerlifting, got a PR of 160KG at Deadlift) to **begin a journey in Judo** at a local gym which is really good! It's called Doryoku and they have an impressive competitive level and really good ambience. It's 3 times a week 2 hours each time, but I go as much as two days and some weeks only a day. **Got yellow belt** and my *tokui-waza* is [Tai Otoshi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ts8Vb2e057Q), or at least I would say it is, maybe it's too soon to tell. Recently **got a 24KG Kettlebell** to keep exercising in dynamic moves mixed with strength.

## Personal Projects

Recently, I also started a project to analyze on which things I'm spending my money on, because it disappears fast and I'm trying to save more hehe

The code repository is called [santander-parser](https://github.com/n0nuser/santander-excel-parser) and it's a microservice made with FastAPI that takes the Excel file you can download from Santander Bank, and stores it in a database. You can filter by quantity, date or range of dates, concept, etc.

Still working on it when I have time.

## Videogames

Bought this week **Asetto Corsa** and its Japanese pack for 3€ and have been playing **Manor Lords** at PC and **Dave the Diver** at the Nintendo Switch.

Dave the Diver is really addicting!

## Family

And when I'm not working, programming or playing videogames... I try to **spend quality time with my girlfriend**!

Went together to Santander and it was really good! Loved the city. Here are [the best photos I took those days](https://flic.kr/s/aHBqjBwqo5).

## End of /now

And that's more or less a recap of my life!
