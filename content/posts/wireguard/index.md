## Wireguard Server Setup

The easiest way to setup a Wireguard server is to use the [Wireguard Easy](https://github.com/WeeJeWel/wg-easy/) docker image from [Emile Nijssen](https://github.com/WeeJeWel).

{{< img "repository.jpg" "WG-Easy" "border" >}}

Following the instructions, you must have Docker installed:

```bash
curl -sSL https://get.docker.com | sh
sudo usermod -aG docker $(whoami)
exit
```

This tutorial will considerate the following diagram:

{{< img "network.jpg" "Network" "border" >}}

Our WAN IP is **123.123.123.123**, our Router LAN IP is **192.168.1.1**, our server IP is **192.168.1.50**. Our public UDP port where we will connect to the VPN is **10000** as a secure measurement: the Docker container will still be listening on UDP port **51820**, while the server will be listening on UDP port **10000**. This will allow to obscure the port used by the server so attackers will have a harder time.

Then, install and run wg-easy:

```bash
docker run -d \
  --name=wg-easy \
  -e WG_HOST=123.123.123.123 \
  -e PASSWORD=mySuperSecurePa$$word \
  -e WG_PORT=PUBLIC PORT \
  -v ~/.wg-easy:/etc/wireguard \
  -p 51820:51820/udp \
  -p 51821:51821/tcp \
  --cap-add=NET_ADMIN \
  --cap-add=SYS_MODULE \
  --sysctl="net.ipv4.conf.all.src_valid_mark=1" \
  --sysctl="net.ipv4.ip_forward=1" \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  weejewel/wg-easy
```

üö® **Be sure to change the values from the environmental variables. `WG_HOST` to suit your WAN IP, `PASSWORD` to be your admin password and `WG_PORT` to be the default 51820 or another one to be more obscure to potential attackers.**

Once the server is running, you can access the admin panel at [http://localhost:51821/](http://localhost:51821/).

In order to access from [http://123.123.123.123:51821](http://123.123.123.123:51821), you must do port forwarding in your router or firewall:

* HOST: 192.168.1.50. INTERNAL PORT: 10000. EXTERNAL PORT: 10000. PROTOCOL: UDP
* HOST: 192.168.1.50. INTERNAL PORT: 51821. EXTERNAL PORT: 51821. PROTOCOL: TCP

## Wireguard Client Setup

First, login to the admin panel.

{{< img "login.png" "Login" "border" >}}

Then, create a client on the web app and give it a name.

### PC

Go to the Wireguard web and [download the installer](https://www.wireguard.com/install/) for your operative system.

#### Windows

Once you have installed the Windows Wireguard client, you should download the config file from the server.

{{< img "windows.png" "Windows" "border" >}}

Click on "Import Tunnel(s) from file" and select the config file.

Voil√°, you have a Windows Wireguard client.

#### Linux

In order to connect to the Wireguard server, first you need to install the Wireguard client.

```bash
sudo apt-get install wireguard wireguard-tools
```

Then, download the configuration from the server and save it in the Wireguard configuration folder:

```bash
sudo cp ~/Downloads/peer.conf /etc/wireguard/wg0.conf
```

Then, enable Wireguard to start at boot:

```bash
sudo systemctl enable wg-quick@wg0.service
sudo systemclt start wg-quick@wg0.service
```

Or just start it manually:

```bash
sudo wg-quick up wg0
```

### Phone

Install the Wireguard app from the [Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.wireguard.android) or the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/wireguard/id1441195209).

Scan the QR by clicking the "+" icon on the top right, and then select "Create from QR" or if you downloaded the config file, select "Create from file".

After scanning the QR it should automatically add the Wireguard server to the list.
