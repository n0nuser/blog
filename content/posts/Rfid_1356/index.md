## Introduction

### Frequency

HF ranges between 3 MHz and 30 MHz.

NFC works exactly at **13.56 MHz** and that‚Äôs why we are able to pay with our phones instead of a normal card, also a phone‚Äôs ability to read card data (not totally in some cases because of its cipher).

### Attacks

As one might think, yes, the HF can be listened with an **SDR** and use in a [Replay Attack](https://salmg.net/2019/06/16/nfcopy85/) or in a [Relay Attack](https://salmg.net/2018/12/01/intro-to-nfc-payment-relay-attacks/) with a device like the [HackRF](https://greatscottgadgets.com/hackrf/one/) as the [CC1101](https://www.ti.com/product/CC1101) can‚Äôt operate in NFC‚Äôs frequency.

### Range

The range from the card to the reader is around **10 centimeters**.

### Common Uses

The most **common uses** are payments like the bus card, access control applications where there‚Äôs the need of knowing who entered/left or access to some privileged area which depends on a job position‚Ä¶ generally where some info needs to be stored.

### Images

The most common card tag is:

But it can also shape a sticker or a tag:

## ISO 14443

The ISO 14443 is the international standard approved by ISO and IEC for 13.56 MHz identification proximity cards, like the access pass I said before.

This standard is split into 4 parts:

- **Part 1: Physical Characteristics**: It defines the physical dimensions, the dynamic flexibility, the alternate electric and magnetic field, static electricity and static magnetic field, and the temperature.
- **Part 2: Radiofrequency power and signal interface**: It defines the electric dimensions, the first dialogue for the card, the working frequency (13.56 MHz), the range of the magnetic resistance and the communication for type A and B.
  - **Type A**: Communicates with reader modulating the signal in `Manchester` code, but if the reader communicated with the tag, the tag would receive the signal coded in `ASK` (*Amplitude Shift Keying*) at 100%. It has a 30% of noise tolerance in the signal, which is pretty high.
  - **Type B**: Communicates with reader modulating the signal in `NRZ` code, but if the reader communicates with the tag, the tag would receive the signal coded in `NRZ` at 10%. It has a 3% of noise tolerance in the signal, which is pretty low.

- **Part 3: Initialization and anti-collision**: It explains the communication between reader and card and defines an anti-collision method; for type A it‚Äôs called *Wise Arbitration* and type B it‚Äôs called *Time-Slot Method*.
- **Part 4: Transmission Protocol**: It specifies the protocol for half-duplex block transmission protocol as it defines the necessities for transmission without contact and the activation/deactivation sequences of the protocol.
    - *Calypso* cards comply with this standard in parts 1,2,3,4 of type B.
    - *[Mifare](https://www.mifare.net/en/products/chip-card-ics/)* cards comply with this standard in parts 1,2,3 of type A.

## HF Chips

There are some brands like iCLASS, Legic, Felica, MIFARE‚Ä¶ but MIFARE is the most common.
