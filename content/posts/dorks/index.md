## Introduction

You can download the cheatsheet as a pdf from [here](./dorks.pdf)!

Searching in Google has become something as normal as drinking water and sometimes we desperately search some information but we can't find it, neither in other languages. 

Doing advanced searches with the use of Google Operators nowadays is a must to be able to extend and improve our findings. From searching for a specific filetype such a pdf or a png image, to use it for hacking and bug bounty!

## Operators

Mixing these operators will let us customize our search to the point of having neat results. In any case, it's best to try them yourself so that you learn them and get comfortable using them in a normal basis. Believe me, a good search will save you lots of time!

I've found some more but the result is nearly the same as a normal search, so I decided not to include them. In any case, if you know some that really makes a difference contact me and I'll add them! ðŸ˜Š

### Restrict Search

## Use of Dorks for Hacking

I found some pages full of examples in which they mix operators with default service/application behaviour so it ends up with an insecure open service that could be exploited. This is very very useful in bug bounties!
