## Introduction

Watching Mr. Robot I got impressed by Rubber Ducky and how you could inject code to a PC by emulating a keyboard, so I decided to get one.

{{< img "rubberducky_mr-robot.png" "RubberDuckys used in Mr. Robot series" "border" >}}

Unfortunately, it costs 60‚Ç¨ in Spain, so I searched over the internet how I could replicate the same idea and firstly I found that pen drives with Physon driver could do that, but to buy one with it is a bit of a lottery. So next was DigiSpark, which is a tiny Arduino board with a USB output, and 3 of them in Amazon costs around 12‚Ç¨, so it‚Äôs very cheap.

DigiSpark can also inject code but it‚Äôs a little bit trickier. In Rubber Ducky you have to put the `file.duck` in its filesystem; here we have to write the `.duck` and transform it to a .ino Arduino readable.

## Installing Arduino and DigiSpark Drivers

To install Arduino, first download it from [Arduino IDE Download](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software), scroll down and select `linux 64 bits`. When download it go to the directory and extract, if via CLI: 

```
tar -xf arduino*.tar.xz
```

Then move that folder to `/opt/` and enter it. Run `./install.sh` and done!

```
sudo mv arduino*/ /opt/
cd arduino*
sudo ./install.sh
```

In general, when installed it should have created a symbolic link in `/usr/local/bin/arduino`, so it should work just by executing `sudo arduino`.

Then run arduino and in `File` go to `Preferences`, in `Additional Board Manager URLs` write this ‚Üì and press OK.

```
http://digistump.com/package_digistump_index.json
```

After that, go to `Tools`, then `Board`, and `Boards Manager`. In the search bar, put `Digistump` and click install on `Digistump AVR Boards`. Then select in `Board` the option `Digispark (Default - 16.5mhz)` and that's it for this part!

## Coding .duck

Rubber Ducky language is ___very simple___ there are few commands, the rest is up to your imagination and skills!

Commands:

- `REM Hello` its for commentaries
- `STRING Hola` writes and entire string
- `DELAY 20` enters a sleep/wait

Keys:

- `ENTER`
- `GUI`, `SHIFT`, `ALT` GUI is the Windows or the Mac key
- `LEFT`, `UP`, `DOWN`, `RIGHT` basic movement keys
- `CTRL-SHIFT ENTER` for key combos


## RubberSpark Framework

RubberSpark is a modular and light-weight framework that aims to provide all the Ducky scripts that you may need in a Red Teaming engagement.

It delivers Ducky Scripts with modifiable parameters (e.g: Reverse Shell. You need to introduce an IP and a Port).

### Screenshots

### Usage

```bash
git clone https://github.com/n0nuser/rubberspark
cd rubberspark
python3 rubberspark.py
```

#### Commands

```txt
Command           Description
-------           -----------
help              Shows this help menu.
list              Shows list of payloads, can be used with arguments. i.E.: list linux
clear             Clears the screen
banner            Display banner.
exit              Exit the framework
```

### Converting DuckyScript to Arduino

For this [Marcus Mengs](https://github.com/mame82) created two python scripts that transform `.duck` to `.bin` ([DuckEncoder](https://github.com/mame82/duckencoder.py)) and `.bin` to `.ino` ([Duck2Spark](https://github.com/mame82/duck2spark)).

After saving the `.duck` script, you can either directly use it in a RubberDucky; or in case of using it in a DigiSpark, you can use the `ccRun.sh` script that uses both MaMe82's Duck2Spark and DuckEncoder. This automates the task of compiling the script all the way directly to an Arduino sketch.

> Be sure to change the locale and the Arduino path if needed!

This is the code of the Bash script:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

## n0nuser
## https://github.com/n0nuser/rubberspark

#####################
# CHANGE THESE VALUES

## e.g.: PATH_ENCODER = 
PATH_ENCODER="resources/duckEncoder/duckencoder.py"

## e.g.: PATH_DUCK2SPARK =
PATH_DUCK2SPARK="resources/duck2spark.py"

## e.g.: PATH_ARDUINO = "arduino"
PATH_ARDUINO="arduino"

KEYBOARD_LANG="es"
#####################

file=$(echo $1 | cut -f 1 -d '.')

encoder="python $PATH_ENCODER -l $KEYBOARD_LANG -i $file.duck -o $file.bin"
spark="python $PATH_DUCK2SPARK -i $file.bin -o $file.ino"
arduino="sudo $PATH_ARDUINO $file.ino"

$($encoder)
$($spark)
$($arduino)
```

To convert the `.duck` file into a `.ino` directly just run:

```
chmod +x ccRun.sh
./ccRun.sh myDuckyScript.duck
```

#### Adding modules

It's as easy as adding a module in each OS folder in `core/modules/`.

You can request an issue to upload a python file with the same structure to keep it in the repo in the future!

Structure of python file:

```py
class info:
    author="AUTHOR"
    description = "DESCRIPTION OF MODULE"
    function = "ITS USE"
    parameters = [ "IP", "PORT" ]
    content = """\
DUCKY
COMMANDS
HERE\
"""
```

### Disclaimer

Do not attempt to violate the law with the framework. If you plan to use it for illegal purposes, then please be sure you have explicit permission, else deny doing it.

I will not hold responsibility for any of your actions.

Don't stick the DigiSpark to the PC for now!

## Uploading the code

And it will open the script compiled in .ino with Arduino, now to upload the script to DigiSpark, click this button:

{{< img "arduino_upload.png" "How to upload the code" "border" >}}

And then plug the DigiSpark üê¶Ô∏è

And that's it for this project tutorial!
