Have been coworking with the API team and the frontend teamin order to understand the requirements and to provide the best solution for the project.

### Insomnia Config Generator

Refactored and optimized an existing Python script that generates an [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/) configuration file from a YAML template and a properties file. The script is now more readable and maintainable, and it is also faster.
