Hi, I'm **Pablo González**, and I'm currently a **Computer Engineer** working at **Axpe Consulting**. My main area of expertise is **back-end engineering** and **web-services development**, particularly using **Python** with **Django**, and **FastAPI**.

I'm a GNU/Linux user and a big advocate of Open Source Software.

I use my site as a method of blogging about my learnings, as well as sharing information about projects I have previously, or are currently, working on in my spare time.
