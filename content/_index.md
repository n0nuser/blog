<span style="font-size:3em; font-weight:500">Hello, I'm **Pablo González**</span>

I'm a Computer Engineer with a focus on backend development and microservices [@uXcale](https://www.uxcale.com/). My work revolves around using Python, Django, and FastAPI to build web applications and microservices that are not only effective but also straightforward and maintainable.

I enjoy the process of solving problems and delivering quality solutions to our clients and team. If you're curious about my professional journey or want to see my [resume](/resume.pdf), feel free to take a look. I'm always open to questions and happy to chat about potential collaborations or just share knowledge.

If you're interested in getting to know me beyond my work, check out my [manual](https://manual.pablogonzalez.me). It's a little peek into who I am outside of engineering. You can also [see the platforms](#contact) I'm active on and reach out to me if you want to connect.
