This a Cybersecurity and Programming blog 👽️

I usually upload different sort of things to ease our life when we have a task in front of us:

* [Cheatsheets](tags/cheatsheet/) about penetration testing and programming 💲
* [System Administration Guides](tags/sysadmin) such as installing a service and how to harden it 📄
* [DIY Projects](tags/projects) such as a Rubber Ducky or a Rogue AP 🔨
* [Writeups](writeups) for [HTB](writeups/htb) or [THM](writeups/thm) machines 👹

You can stay tuned for upcoming posts with the [RSS feed](index.xml)!

I’m Pablo Jesús González Rubio and I was born in Salamanca (Spain) in 02/2000.

* I’ve been playing and tinkering with computers since I was 8, from there my passion for this field.
* I'm very passionate about Red-Teaming operations, Pentesting, System Administration, and automating easy and complex tasks via scripting. Much of that can be seen in my [Github](https://github.com/n0nuser/).
