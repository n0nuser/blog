I’m Pablo Jesús González Rubio and I was born in Salamanca (Spain) in 02/2000.

* I’ve been playing and tinkering with computers since I was 8, from there my passion for this field.
* I'm very passionate about Red-Teaming operations, Pentesting, System Administration, and automating easy and complex tasks via scripting. Much of that can be seen in my [Github](https://github.com/n0nuser/).
