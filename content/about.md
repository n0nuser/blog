Hello there! I’m Pablo 👋, a Computer Engineer with a deep dive into backend development, microservices, a passion for crafting performant systems 🚀 and a Clean Code advocate 🥑. My professional life is driven by a love for Python 🐍, a desire for creating robust system architectures 🏗️, and a continuous quest for improving code quality ✨.

For a more detailed look into my professional journey, skills, and personal interests, you can [check my resume](/resume.pdf)! 📄

## Beyond the Screen

When I'm not working you might find me:

* Listening to music almost anytime 🎵
* Spending quality time with my family and friends 🍻
* Empowering my digital Diogenes syndrome 🎮
* Power-lifting things (Deadlift PR of 160KG and now exercising with 24KG Kettlebell) 🏋️‍♂️
* Nurturing my plants, when I remember to do it 🪴
* Improving my [Tai Otoshi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ts8Vb2e057Q) 🥋
* Searching my will to read good dark fantasy books I've been lurking for a while 📚

As a matter fact, my favourite food is ramen 🍜, and I'm always up for a good bowl of it!
Although I won't say no to a good Tonkatsu hehe 🍛

Also, thinking of it now... Spanish omelette 🍳, Hornazo 🥪, Farinato, a good BBQ...

Writing this made me hungry... 🤤😅
