Hello there! I’m Pablo 👋, a Computer Engineer with a deep dive into backend development, microservices, and a zest for crafting performant systems 🚀. My professional life is driven by a love for Python 🐍, a desire for creating robust system architectures 🏗️, and a continuous quest for improving code quality ✨. I’m all about building efficient and well-designed technology solutions that not only work effectively but also evolve to meet the highest standards of excellence.

## My Professional Path

I started my journey at Panelais, and I'm now at uXcale, I've honed my skills in Python, Django, and FastAPI, managing projects that range from AI backend projects, Web Apps to comprehensive microservices deployed on AWS 🌐.

## What Drives Me

There's a special kind of joy in simplifying complex problems and delivering streamlined solutions 🧩. I'm a staunch advocate for clean code and solid system design, but I'm also realistic about the challenges of technical debt and the need for agile innovation ⚙️.

I thrive when I'm able to buckle down, break tasks into manageable pieces, and tackle them head-on. This approach has shaped not only my work but also the way I collaborate with peers and contribute to our community 🤝.

## Beyond the Screen

Off duty, you'll find me nurturing my plants 🪴, indulging in sports activities related with strength and technique 🏋️‍♂️🥋, conquering the virtual worlds of video games 🎮, or lost in the pages of a good dark fantasy or self improvement book 📚. And yes, I’m a big fan of Japanese cuisine – the way to my heart is definitely through sushi and ramen 🍣🍜.

## Let's Connect

I'm always up for connecting with fellow tech enthusiasts, whether it’s for project collaboration, sharing Python tips, or just a friendly chat. Feel free to reach out, and let’s see what we can build together 🌟.
